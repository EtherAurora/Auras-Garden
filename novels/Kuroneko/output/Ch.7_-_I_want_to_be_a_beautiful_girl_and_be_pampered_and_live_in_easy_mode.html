                <p>: LOL</p>
                
                <p>: What happened</p>
                
                <p>: Probably the collab</p>
                
                <p>[That's right it's about the collab that was decided before I even knew it!!!]</p>
                
                <p>It was the day after the collab with Natsunami Yui.</p>
                
                <p>While lying down on my bed and searching online about myself, which has become a routine, my senpai Sera Matsuri made a shocking announcement.</p>
                
                <p>On yesterday stream, you definitely said you wanted to collaborate, but even so I thought it was just lip service?</p>
                
                <p>People with communication problems are creatures that can't take other people's words seriously.</p>
                
                <p>If someone said "if it's possible to do so~", I'd have high hopes, but deep down in my heart, I don't think it'll happen. Something like that.</p>
                
                <p>But to think some idiot is actually doing it! And without my permission! How meticulous of her to make an announcement and block my escape route!</p>
                
                <p>Immediately after that, when I contacted my manager to confirm, I was told that "There was no problem because that was the plan."</p>
                
                <p>Although it seems sudden, Sera Matsuri laid down some firm groundwork.</p>
                
                <p>This is bad!</p>
                
                <p>[I was planning to take a day off, but I will be holding this emergency countermeasures meeting.]</p>
                
                <p>: Well, I'll take anything as long as you're streaming.</p>
                
                <p>: Okay, you can leave it to me.</p>
                
                <p>: Even though there's a chance Matsuri-chan will show up here, we are still going to have a countermeasures meeting...</p>
                
                <p>[Ah... should I block her?]</p>
                
                <p>: Idiot!</p>
                
                <p>: Stop that, stop that, stop that!</p>

                <p>[We, well, senpai, I'm streaming right now, and I can't look at that kind of private content or know about it for the next two hours, and if possible I'd like to ignore it for eternity.Yep.]</p>

                <p>[No, don't reply with a question mark!]</p>
                
                <p>In the meantime, the chat has more and more comments like "Hurry up and look", "Don't make your senpai wait", "Make sure to discuss it properly"</p>
                
                <p>Even though it's my stream, why is no one on my side?</p>

                <p>:What a foul mouth</p>
                
                <p>This is in no way an appropriate invitation to a post-approved collab.</p>
                
                <p>It's basically "I've decided on the date, so I'll leave the rest to you!" This isn't what collabing with a senior should be like!</p>
                
                <p>And when I got angry, Matsuri-senpai just said "That is it," and disappeared from the chat.</p>
                
                <p>I wonder if she showed up in the stream just to show me the LINE messages. Senpai you're too free spirited...</p>
                
                <p>[Okay, for the time being the demon has left, so I would like to proceed with the countermeasures conference.]</p>
                
                <p>: Finally the main point</p>
                
                <p>: give up and beg Yui-chan while crying.</p>
                
                <p>: It's a bit crazy to have an off-collab with a senpai, a little over a week since your debut.</p>
                
                <p>: Matsuri's footwork is just too nimble.</p>
                
                <p>[I wonder if you should call her footwork nimble or just careless... Is there a way to turn down the collab?]</p>
                
                <p>: Give up</p>
                
                <p>: It's over the moment you're spotted</p>
                
                <p>: Is this rookie killing?</p>
                
                <p>Gee.</p>
                
                <p>I wonder what Matsuri-senpai likes about me.</p>
                
                <p>Even half a year after the debut of the 1st generation, there aren't many streamers who are doing off collabs.</p>
                
                <p>Of course with the increase in the numbers of the 2nd gen members, it's inevitable that there will be more off-collabs, but normally, they happen a month or so after the debut and the 2nd gen should do off-collabs with each other before getting involved with the other generations.</p>
                
                <p>The only trace of a 2nd gen collab can only be yesterday's nursing stream.</p>
                
                <p>[I was entrusted with the contents of the collab, but what would you guys like to see? I think it would be nice if we played a game in separate rooms.]</p>
                
                <p>: Do you know the meaning of off-collab~?</p>
                
                <p>: If you think too hard, you won't be able to make good decisions.</p>
                
                <p>: Talking is the safest route.</p>
                
                <p>: What about a singing collab?</p>
                
                <p>: I want to see some TeeTee.</p>
                
                <p>[My heart is already filled with TeeTee.]</p>
                
                <p>: Ha?</p>
                
                <p>: Ha?</p>
                
                <p>: Dislike pressed.</p>
                
                <p>: What are you saying all of a sudden?</p>
                
                <p>: I'm unsubbing</p>
                
                <p>[Oh, sorry, I'm sorry.]</p>
                
                <p>Let's postpone the content of the collab for now.</p>
                
                <p>What should be prioritized above everything else are the countermeasures.</p>
                
                <p>[I unterstand that it's important to decide the content of the converation after refleciting on yesterday's stream. Therefore, I'll have you guys create an talk deck for me. One that even I can use without destroying the mood, Alright get to work write it.]</p>
                
                <p>: Using others for your own gain</p>
                
                <p>: Think it by yourself</p>
                
                <p>: Weather deck</p>
                
                <p>: Dinner deck</p>
                
                <p>: "I love you" game</p>
                
                <p>: Forbidden love talk</p>
                
                <p>: Take the initiative with an aggressive attitude. Tell her your fetishes from the start.</p>
                
                <p>[There aren't any good ideas!! You guys didn't say that you guys also have no ability to talk???]</p>
                
                <p>Most of the comments are filled with jokes.</p>
                
                <p>It's rude to ask the senpais about their salaries.</p>
                
                <p>: You're the one that can't talk!</p>
                
                <p>: You lost the moment you asked the viewers</p>
                
                <p>: For now, just praise the other person.</p>
                
                <p>[Guu... Hmm, it is probably a good idea to praise her.]</p>
                
                <p>No one dislikes being praised, and if you're having trouble with a conversation, just praise the other person.</p>
                
                <p>You don't need any skills to praise someone, and although it may be a little bit different from the content of the talk, it is definitely a good trick.</p>
                
                <p>[Then, based on what I learned from yesterday stream, let's imagine I'm talking with Natsunami Yui-san and try it out on her]</p>
                
                <p>: Revenge</p>
                
                <p>: keep it up</p>
                
                <p>: Just don't use the weather deck from yesterday.</p>
                
                <p>[Okay. Mmm. Umm, Natsunami-san those are some nice breasts you have there]</p>
                
                <p>: OUTTT!</p>
                
                <p>: Idiot!!</p>
                
                <p>: That's sexual harassment!!!</p>
                
                <p>[Huh!? Complimenting the other person's appearance is the basics of a conversation!? Didn't you know? On top of that, I didn't say boobs, so it isn't sexual harassment??]</p>
                
                <p>I would be happy to hear that.</p>
                
                <p>There's no doubt that it is a good idea to tell others what I would like to hear.</p>
                
                <p>However, the chat is flying with great momentum.</p>
                
                <p>That's weird...</p>
                
                <p>[Umm, you look like you're good with boys! Your body is erotic! Your voice is lewd! Youkya!(1)]</p>
                
                <p>:She'll get angry at you</p>
                
                <p>: Conflict?</p>
                
                <p>: Sponge brain</p>
                
                <p>[Huhhh~~??]</p>
                
                <p>Maybe normal people wouldn't be happy to hear these?</p>
                
                <p>From a man's point of view, I'd like that kind of thing, and from a woman's point of view, they are popular traits, so I would be happy!</p>
                
                <p>Maybe if I talk about other good points...</p>
                
                <p>[Oh, do you have any other talk techniques? Something like a guide for dumbasses...]</p>
                
                <p>: If you can't even give compliments, no technique will help.</p>
                
                <p>: have 6 collabs with your gen mates in a week</p>
                
                <p>: Just practice</p>
                
                <p>[N, no way]</p>
                
                <p>: No matter how many decks or techniques you prepare, it won't work if you don't have the basics of talking down.</p>
                
                <p>: It's useless if you can't talk</p>
                
                <p>: Even if you have the strongest magic, it doesn't mean anything if you don't have enough magic power.</p>
                
                <p>I see.</p>
                
                <p>All the comments in the chat are very useful.</p>
                
                <p>No matter how strong the deck is, if I don't know how to play it, it's meaningless.</p>
                
                <p>On the other hand, even the weakest deck can be used depending on how well you can use it!</p>
                
                <p>I fell like I can understand the secret of the people with good communication ability.</p>
                
                <p>[Then how can I improve how I play!]</p>
                
                <p>: Practice, that's it</p>
                
                <p>: It's about how many times you've done it</p>
                
                <p>: Even if you die, you have to try</p>
                
                <p>[I wouldn't be having a hard time if I could do that!!!]</p>
                
                <p>In order to have better communication skills, you first need to have communication skills.</p>
                
                <p>It's like when you want the monster's dropped equipment, but the most efficient way to kill the monster is by using said equipment.</p>
                
                <p>What I want to make is that equipment!</p>
