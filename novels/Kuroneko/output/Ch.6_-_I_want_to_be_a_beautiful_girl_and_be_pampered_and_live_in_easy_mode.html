                <p>: What will happen?</p>
                
                <p>[Hello]</p>
                
                <p>: Hello</p>
                
                <p>: It's finally time for the collab to start!</p>
                
                <p>[Yes! Today is as announced, a collab!]</p>
                
                <p>[...]</p>
                
                <p>[Kuroneko-san, Kuroneko-san? Hello?]</p>
                
                <p>: Uh oh</p>
                
                <p>: She ran away from the enemy attack</p>
                
                <p>This is bad. I feel nauseous. My whole body is turning pale.</p>
                
                <p>I stared blankly at the screen, opening and closing my mouth like a fish.</p>
                
                <p>Talking in front of a large group...?</p>
                
                <p>Impossible...</p>
                
                <p>[Huh? The call is connected. Is there something wrong with her mic?]</p>
                
                <p>: Stream accident?</p>
                
                <p>: Accidents are a daily occurrence with Kuroneko-san</p>
                
                <p>: It's the first time she had a mic accident, though?</p>
                
                <p>Gradually, the comments were filed with Natsunami Yui's fans worrying about me and my fans telling me to "Hurry up and come out."</p>
                
                <p>It seems like my fans know how to deal with me even though it's only been a few days since my debut.</p>
                
                <p>I'm sure they're recalling what happened in the first stream in their heads.</p>
                
                <p>Guess I have no choice but to do it...</p>
                
                <p>[Ko, Konbannya...]</p>
                
                <p>[Kuroneko-san!? Your volume is so low!?]</p>
                
                <p>: Wrong, her voice is small</p>
                
                <p>: So is her stature</p>
                
                <p>: Her breasts too, more than anything else</p>
                
                <p>Snap.</p>
                
                <p>[Who are you calling flat chested!?]</p>
                
                <p>I think there are things you should or shouldn't say!?</p>
                
                <p>[Okay! With that out of the way, today I'll be collabing with Kuroneko-Chan. Yaaay!]</p>
                
                <p>[Ni, Nice to meet you...]</p>
                
                <p>[Kuroneko-san, there's not enough energy in your voice come on, cheer up]</p>
                
                <p>This girl</p>
                
                <p>The other day she told me she had a communication problem, but no matter how I look at it, She's no amateur, and it's definitely used to talking. She was definitely a pro in her previous life!</p>
                
                <p>[Well, I was the one who asked for this collab, in fact I've been wanting to collab with you ever since I saw your first stream.]</p>
                
                <p>[Uee!?]</p>
                
                <p>[Because no newcomer would do what you did in the first stream when everyone was nervous!]</p>
                
                <p>[Oh, that...]</p>
                
                <p>Script leak. Forcibly closed stream after 15 minutes. Ignored the character settings. I want to be pampered.</p>
                
                <p>Why am I still a VTuber again...?</p>
                
                <p>[I was sure it would be fun to collaborate with you!]</p>
                
                <p>[Oh, thank you for the compliment? I guess?]</p>
                
                <p>: She's praising you, LOL</p>
                
                <p>: Trowing balloons on others is fun</p>
                
                <p>: ↑ That's evil</p>
                
                <p>: Kuroneko-San, is talking way less than usual, are you okay?</p>
                
                <p>: It was too early for a collab...</p>
                
                <p>[Now, let's hurry up! Let's move on to the marshmallows!]</p>
                
                <p>After saying that, Natsunami changed the screen.</p>
                
                <p>She seems to have picked the marshmallows in advance, but she didn't tell me the details.</p>
                
                <p>In others words, I was assigned an extremely difficult mission to survive an interpersonal battle with Natsunami Yui unknown, unscripted and improvised performance.</p>
                
                <p>Isn't this too hard of a challenge even for a second life?</p>
                
                <p>[Okay! First one! 'Kuroneko-san and Yui-chan, good morning and hello. Since it's a question for the collab, please tell me what your first impression of the other was!' as I just said, I thought she was a really amusing and cute girl. How about you, Kuroneko-San?]</p>
                
                <p>[Ah, erm... First impression. First impression...]</p>
                
                <p>I was quietly holding my breath during the whole call, so I don't even know who said what.</p>
                
                <p>And after my debut, I was lectured by my manager, so I missed her stream.</p>
                
                <p>In other words, the previous call was the first time we actually talked.</p>
                
                <p>Then...</p>
                
                <p>[Brown haired, big breasted, Sunshine personality...]</p>
                
                <p>[Ha?]</p>
                
                <p>: no good</p>
                
                <p>: Don't say the first thing that comes to mind in a collab!</p>
                
                <p>: Is your brain made of sponge?</p>
                
                <p>Yui Natsunami model is a high school student with her hair tied up in a side ponytail.</p>
                
                <p>Unlike me, she wears her school uniform in a cool way, emphasizing her cleavage.</p>
                
                <p>It wouldn't be an exaggeration to say that this appearance is one of the reasons I can't get along with her.</p>
                
                <p>I'm sure the management will make new illustrations of her lying down suntanning when summer comes around.</p>
                
                <p>[Eh, um. Next question then.]</p>
                
                <p>: Amazing, she killed Yui's momentum with one phrase</p>
                
                <p>: She didn't even think anything</p>
                
                <p>: Why are you fighting even though it's a collab?</p>
                
                <p>: Extroverted vs Introverted battle</p>
                
                <p>['I have a question for the two JKs{1}! Please tell me what type of man you like!' There were a lot of questions like this~]</p>
                
                <p>: I'm curious</p>
                
                <p>: If it happens to me, what should I do?</p>
                
                <p>: ↑ Ignore it</p>
                
                <p>: They haven't even started yet</p>
                
                <p>[I guess I like guys who are dependable after all. Someone who will help you immediately if you're in trouble! But it's even better if they don't ask for anything in return!]</p>
                
                <p>: The last part is a bit though</p>
                
                <p>: Somewhat realistic</p>
                
                <p>: Could it be me?</p>
                
                <p>[What about you Kuroneko-san]</p>
                
                <p>[Uhhh, I don't like men...]</p>
                
                <p>: Fa?</p>

                <p>: A Shocking confession</p>
                
                <p>Sometimes I forget, but I was a man.</p>
                
                <p>It's been over ten years since I was reborn as a woman, so I don't feel like I'm a man, and it has been such a long time that I don't feel uncomfortable being a woman.</p>
                
                <p>Even so, the feelings that had been ingrained in me for so many years will not disappear, and there are still traces of me being a man here and there.</p>
                
                <p>The inability to see man as a romantic interest is one of those traces.</p>
                
                <p>That being said, It's also questionable if I see woman as possible romantic interests...</p>
                
                <p>[Umm. Hmm. What shall I do?]</p>
                
                <p>: I'm really worried</p>
                
                <p>: You collabed with the wrong person...</p>
                
                <p>: Does this count as a light accident?</p>
                
                <p>: You just noticed?</p>
                
                <p>Even I who have been called a mess recently, understood.</p>
                
                <p>The subtle atmosphere of this broadcast was completely my fault.</p>
                
                <p>Because talking to people wears me out, I still gave too much control to my conversation partner.</p>
                
                <p>This is a stream that everyone was looking forward to, so I have to extend the talk so to make it more exciting.</p>
                
                <p>[Oh, um! The weather was nice today!]</p>
                
                <p>[Um, ah yeah. That's right.]</p>
                
                <p>End of Conversation.</p>
                
                <p>: She had to bring out the weather deck!</p>
                
                <p>: I can feel the growth in her, try to start a conversation.</p>
                
                <p>: That's one small step for mankind, and one giant leap for Kuroneko-san.</p>
                
                <p>: Mr. Armstrong is so proud.</p>
                
                <p>[Okay! Then let's move on to the next one. 'Excuse me, this is my first marshmallow. Are there any 1st gen senpais that you deeply respect? There were many questions about our senpais. We still respect the senpais, even if we don't mention their names, okay?]</p>
                
                <p>: Okay</p>
                
                <p>: We don't mind</p>
                
                <p>[Well, the senpai that I look up the most is Kinomiya Kirin-senpai. A lively and serious honor student! Even among the 1st gen who have strong personalities, she's strong and keeps everyone together! I admire her a lot~]</p>
                
                <p>Kinomiya Kirin.</p>
                
                <p>In a sense, she was the senior who gave me the chance to start in this world.</p>
                
                <p>She is a central figure in the 1st gen and is often appointed for announcements and events, but she is in a disadvantageous position since she is not actually the leader.</p>
                
                <p>Speaking of which, I feel that Natsunami Yui somehow resembles Kirin-senpai</p>
                
                <p>[I'm interessed in Matsuri-sanpai, I guess...]</p>
                
                <p>[Matsuri-senpai is really cool, isn't she?]</p>
                
                <p>: Come to think of it, Matsuri-chan said she was worried about Kuroneko-san</p>
                
                <p>: Ah, the stream just now</p>
                
                <p>[Hmm!? I was so nervous that I couldn't watch the stream just now. nya]</p>
                
                <p>: Isn't voice lovestruck!</p>
                
                <p>: Don't flirt with your "nya"</p>
                
                <p>: Matsuneko Teteee [3]?</p>
                
                <p>Sera Matsuri: Jiiii [4]</p>
                
                <p>: Matsuri-chan!?</p>
                
                <p>: You're here!</p>
                
                <p>[Awawawa Matsuri-senpai is here!!?]</p>
                
                <p>[Oh, I forgot to give you mod, so I'll do it now.]</p>
                
                <p>Sera Matsuri ✓: Kuroneko-san, let's do collab next time.</p>
                
                <p>[Weeeee!?]</p>
                
                <p>[Senpai!? What about me!? This is my stream!?]</p>
                
                <p>Sera Matsuri ✓: I think you should collab with Kirin instead.</p>
                
                <p>: (Possibly) pouting?</p>
                
                <p>: Cute</p>
                
                <p>And Matsuri-senpai just said what she wanted and left.</p>
                
                <p>I knew from watching her, but she really is someone who works on her own pace.</p>
                
                <p>Or rather, was she serious about the collab?</p>
                
                <p>The development is so sudden that I'm suspecting it is just lip service.</p>
                
                <p>[Anyway, let's move on! Timewise, this will be the last one 'Greetings to all of Arutema. I always enjoy watching the streams. I found fascinating that it ended normally in 40 minutes without falling off the number one spot even once. By the way, from the 2nd gen members who have made a spectacular debut, who would the two of you like to collab next? I'm also rooting for you, so do your best.' Sorry for not falling down the rankings during the stream! Next time we'll be number one several times in a row]</p>
                
                <p>: Sounds like that hell</p>
                
                <p>: I laughed at how quickly it ended</p>
                
                <p>: It's almost an endurance competition at this point.</p>
                
                <p>[Okay! But the question is about the next collab, isn't it? There are 7 members in 2nd gen. The others are Reese El Rislit-san, Endori Eika-san, Izayoi Sakuraka-san, Toba Otoha-san and Gaou Kamitachi-san Wow everyone has a strong personality]</p>
                
                <p>[The name Gaou Kamitachi[5]  is amazing...]</p>
                
                <p>: Could it be that these two are actually decent people?</p>
                
                <p>: Kuroneko-san is decent?</p>
                
                <p>:At least Yui-chan is decent!?</p>
                
                <p>: Yui-chan is the one with common sense</p>
                
                <p>[Hahaha, thank you. That's right, I'm the one with common sense.]</p>
                
                <p>She laughed dryly</p>
                
                <p>[The next collab, I think Reese-san will be safe- I mean fun]</p>
                
                <p>: It is like Minesweeper</p>
                
                <p>:Shhh</p>
                
                <p>[I don't really want to colla...]</p>
                
                <p>[Hmm??]</p>
                
                <p>[Ah. Toba Otoha-san]</p>
                
                <p>Toba-san is the quietest person in the group.</p>
                
                <p>Whether we get along or not, I won't have to worry too much.</p>
                
                <p>In the meantime, an hour had already passed since the start of the stream.</p>
                
                <p>It's about time no one will complain if we end the stream.</p>
                
                <p>[Alright it's about time we end the stream]</p>
                
                <p>[Yay]</p>
                
                <p>[Would you like to do an extra hour?]</p>
                
                <p>[Sorry]</p>
                
                <p>After saying "Good grief" and said a few announcements, she directed the conversation towards me.</p>
                
                <p>No but, there were no announcements...</p>
                
                <p>[Ah, yes. Then I would like to end with that. Please subscribe to our channels, turn on the notifications, give us a high rating, and follow me on Twitter! Kuroneko's channel is in the summary collumn, so please take care of it. Bye bye.]</p>
