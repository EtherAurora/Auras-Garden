                <p>Santa-san appeared in my dream, so I wished, “I want to become a beautiful girl and live my life on easy mode!” I'm not a pervert, anyone would have this kind of wish. Right? Please say yes. That's why, before I knew it, I had become a girl. I think it's abrupt even for me.</p>
                
                <p>◆</p>
                
                <p>My current name is Kurone Koyoi, I'm a naive and fearless 4-year-old.</p>
                
                <p>When I first reincarnated, I couldn't keep up with the situation of TS reincarnation, but after four years I have come to accept it, and now I can play with girls with cute stuffed animals in my hand. I don't have any particular problem about the mental age and gender gap, which is common in other works. Yes, I accept everything as it is, with a heart like running water. When in reality-</p>
                
                <p>“Koyoi-chan, Usa-chan won't fight with Rider-san.”</p>
                
                <p>“Nn, it's okay. The bunny will win in the end.”</p>
                
                <p>“There's nothing okay with that.”</p>
                
                <p>Why can't I make dolls fight when playing house?!</p>
                
                <p>As I played according to my hearth, the number of friends around me decreased one by one.</p>
                
                <p>“It seems that the problem is that Rider doesn't win in the duel between the stuffed bunny and Rider.” I didn't know, though.</p>
                
                <p>“But it is only playing house, it's not like it matters who wins!”</p>
                
                <p>After experiencing such a childhood, I entered elementary school early and graduated without any concerns.</p>
                
                <p>“There is a problem right here”</p>
                
                <p>I reincarnated with the wish, "I want to become a beautiful girl and live my life on easy mode!" However, the current situation is far from it, it is a fiasco of a life with zero friends.</p>
                
                <p>How did this happen? How did this happen!!?</p>
                
                <p>“I thought I would be an unrivaled cheat in my second life”</p>
                
                <p>For example, taking advantage of my second life to make a debut as a child actor, or mastering all kind of performing arts.</p>
                
                <p>And what about reality?</p>
                
                <p>I didn't learn my lesson and spent my life living lazily every day, I don't have any special skills or talents. Let alone 100 friends, even one is suspicious.</p>
                
                <p>Just before entering middle school, I realized.</p>
                
                <p>“Could it be that I'll just waste time in this life…?”</p>
                
                <p>“It can't go on like this, it's too bad.”</p>
                
                <p>“I'm going to make my middle school debut and live a little…!”</p>
                
                <p>[Tomorrow is the entrance ceremony]</p>
                
                <p>It was already the third year of middle school, and I still didn't get any results!</p>
                
                <p>Even though I was determined to make my middle school debut, I kept expecting for something to happen every day. And with those hopes in my heart, I entered high school.</p>
                
                <p>“That's right, I'm already a fully grown person.”</p>
                
                <p>In order to not live in vain and avoid the crisis I sensed, I sought to change, However, I did nothing as the days went by.</p>
                
                <p>People always have the habit of making things up in their minds, but when it comes down to it, they don't put it into practice and only get more frustrated.</p>
                
                <p>Even if I reincarnated to live a convenient life, neither my own nature nor the system of the word, which was cruel and merciless, did not change.</p>
                
                <p>With that, I entered high school!</p>
                
                <p>“My name is Kurone Koyoi. Umm, my hobby is reading, and I don't have any special skills. Thank you very much…”</p>
                
                <p>I don't learn</p>
                
                <p>I'm so thoroughly stupid that I won't learn.</p>
                
                <p>Not only that, but I have lots of jumbled thoughts in my head, and when I open my mouth, I can't speak. And my talk power is nonexistent.</p>
                
                <p>I'm a hopeless, komyushou [1]…!</p>
                
                <p>It's impossible to redo your high school debut.</p>
                
                <p>From my surroundings, the lifeless and sparse applause. My stomach hurts.</p>
                
                <p>“Then it's my turn. Haruto Kobayashi, I used to play soccer in middle school. My favorite things are going out with my friends and karaoke. There aren't many people from my middle school at this school, so I want to make a lot of friends. You're free to ask my LINE. Nice to meet you.”</p>
                
                <p>“Haruto-kun, trade with me.” “Eh, me too.”</p>
                
                <p>Tsu, tsueeeeeeee [2].</p>
                
                <p>Kobayashi-kun, who's sitting behind me, is so much of a komyukyou [3]</p>
                
                <p>I feel like I've been shown what a real top caste is like, my self-introduction can even be considered an opening performance.</p>
                
                <p>I don't want to be like the screaming girl, Therefore, I stubbornly didn't look back.</p>
                
                <p>With his silky brown hair and putting the mask of a sweet smile, he has already established his position in the top of the class. On top of that, he's waving his hand as if he is some sort of celebrity. I don't understand the meaning of waving your hand in the classroom, I don't understand it at all.</p>
                
                <p>Despite me being overwhelmed by the inferiority complex and pressure, the self-introductions continued without a hitch. In the end, I was probably the one with the weakest self-introduction.</p>
                
                <p>Then, after a quick explanation from the teacher, we were dismissed for the day.</p>
                
                <p>I held my bag, which had become quite heavy with textbooks, under my arms.</p>
                
                <p>"Ah, you are Kurone-san, right? After this, we're talking about going to the karaoke with everyone, What do you think?"</p>
                
                <p>It was Kobayashi-kun who called out to me.</p>
                
                <p>"Eh, ah, umm"</p>
                
                <p>"Ah, you have something to do after this. I'm sorry for holding you back"</p>
                
                <p>"No, it's okay..."</p>
                
                <p>Stuttering while talking to my classmate and saying a polite "Ok, goodbye."</p>
                
                <p>Isn't it too miserable?</p>
                
                <p>But, let's not get mad at Kobayashi-kun here.</p>
                
                <p>He genuinely cared about me from start to finish, and when I couldn't reply, he purposely gave me a way out.</p>
                
                <p>It's hard to find such a perfect Komyukyou. If I had to point out a mistake, it would be that he called out to someone like me who had a problem with communication.</p>
                
                <p>Well, and just like that, my entrance ceremony came to an abrupt end.</p>
                
                <p>Once in a lifetime, twice in reincarnation. Contrary to my expectations, the entrance ceremony, which would greatly affect my future, ended up with me not being able to do anything.</p>
                
                <p>"I'm home"</p>
                
                <p>Even if I said that, there was no response.</p>
                
                <p>When I come home, I first start my computer. And in the meantime change my clothes and work hard on my daily routine which consists of surfing the internet.</p>
                
                <p>I don't talk at school, and at home I type on my computer all the time. Haha, what a blissful youth.</p>
                
                <p>I casually skim through the news and write an "I'm tired" on my SNS account that doesn't have many followers.</p>
                
                <p>"Even if you don't have real friends, there are many online." As if there could be such a convenient story, as expected there's no one I can call a friend online. At best, It's a shallow relationship in a game where they occasionally reply a word or two.</p>
                
                <p>After I finish my routine, the next step is to log on my social game for my login bonus and stamina while looking at random titles of random sites and jumping through links over and over again.</p>
                
                <p>While skimming through articles with interesting titles, I found one that caught my eyes.</p>
                
                <p>[{Signs of a trend} What's VTuber that is currently a hot topic?]</p>
                
                <p>"Ah, it is already that time?"</p>
                
                <p>It's easy to forget these days, but I'm a reincarnated person. And this world is not a fantasy world nor a modern novel world with superpowers, it is a very ordinary world.</p>
                
                <p>However, it's not lie everything is the same as my previous life, there are celebrities I don't know among familiar celebrities, and conversely, some superstars have disappeared, therefore i came to understand that this is a parallel world.</p>
                
                <p>So here's what's important.</p>
                
                <p>It is now 2017.</p>
                
                <p>And my previous life continued until 2020.</p>
                
                <p>In other words, my reincarnation was a TS reincarnation sub-genre, "Regression TS Reincarnation."</p>
                
                <p>No, if it was regression, then I would be able to use my future knowledge to my advantage. Even now, when I read web novels, I want to protest. However, although this world is a similar world, it is still a parallel world. For example, there is Rider [4] but not his squadron, There is FF[5] but no DQ[6], and Nobunaga is a woman and is called Nobuhime in this world.</p>
                
                <p>In such a world, I can't go TUEEEE!! [7] Using my future knowledge. I abandoned that kind of thing when I was four years old.</p>
                
                <p>----- Let's go back to the topic.</p>
                
                <p>2017 is an era that otakus will never forget as the dawn of the VTuber era.</p>
                
                <p>VTubers, which had never seen the light of day until, now exploded in popularity after a certain event at the end of the year.</p>
                
                <p>And even in this life, VTubers exist without problems.</p>
                
                <p>However, there is no figure of her, who was called the boss, Instead there is a substitute VTuber fighting for her place.</p>
                
                <p>Even if the end of the year event doesn't happen, based on my experience so far, history follows a more or less similar path, so I think VTubers will probably become popular from here on out.</p>
                
                <p>I wonder if I should make an investment now and get some long-time fans...</p>
                
                <p>Well, it's still April, so I can leave it alone for a while.</p>
                
                <p>While thinking about such things, I read another aggregator site.</p>
                
                <p>[1] Komyushou = someone who sucks at communicating</p>
                
                <p>[2] Tsue = Slang for strong</p>
                
                <p>[3] Komyukyou = the opposite of Komyushou</p>
                
                <p>[4] Kamen Rider</p>
                
                <p>[5] Final Fantasy</p>
                
                <p>[6] Dragon Quest</p>
                
                <p>[7] Same as 2</p>
