                <p>And so the season passed.</p>
                
                <p>I'm a second year student from today.</p>
                
                <p>This past year, a lot of thingsâ€¦ didn't happen.</p>
                
                <p>Yes, as you can imagine. I like every year, spent the first year of high school idle.</p>
                
                <p>Friends? "No."</p>
                
                <p>Lovers? "Haha."</p>
                
                <p>On the day of the entrance ceremony, the majority of the class had already participated in karaoke and the groups have already been formed. Since I didn't participate in the event, I couldn't find the group I belonged to, and I didn't have the courage to join the shady group at the back of my class, so I had no choice but to live my mess of a life.</p>
                
                <p>But that changes today.</p>
                
                <p>It's a fact that when you change classes at the beginning of the year, the friendships will be partially reset.</p>
                
                <p>I have to make up for the first year here, otherwise there's no doubt that the next two years that he next two years will be stained gray for me.</p>
                
                <p>"Yes, congratulations on your graduation. Tears come to my eyes when I think that I'll be seeing your faces for the next two years."</p>
                
                <p>A bearded middle-aged man, who was my homeroom teacher in the first year, entered the classroom while saying such things.</p>
                
                <p>"Well, I think everyone knows, but in our school, the classes stay the same for all three years."</p>
                
                <p>Eh?</p>
                
                <p>I didn't know that, though.</p>
                
                <p>â—†</p>
                
                <p>[Konkirin~. I'm Kirin Kinomiya, a VTuber from Arutema.]</p>
                
                <p>A beautiful girl is on the screen.</p>
                
                <p>It is not a real human girl, but an animated character, from something called Live 2D.</p>
                
                <p>As of 2018, otaku culture was taken to a new stage by VTubers.</p>
                
                <p>[Today we will be holding a monetization congratulation stream.]</p>
                
                <p>:Â¥500 Congrats on monetization!</p>
                
                <p>:Â¥10,000 Take this superchat.</p>
                
                <p>:Â¥250 First superchat.</p>
                
                <p>[Wow, thank you for the superchats! I wanted to read all the names, but it is too fast, and I can't keep up.]</p>
                
                <p>:Â¥1,000 Speed up more and more.</p>
                
                <p>:Â¥500 Don't force yourself.</p>
                
                <p>:Â¥2,525 I'm following you since your debut. I think Kirin-chan is still growing, so keep doing your best!</p>
                
                <p>:Â¥50,000.</p>
                
                <p>[Thank you, thank you very much! Wow! 50,000 yen silently!? Okay!?]</p>
                
                <p>Superchats fly trough by the second.</p>
                
                <p>The momentum is boundless, and it's not hard to see that the comment section will be colorfully filled with superchats for at least another 10 minutes.</p>
                
                <p>Even if this amount of money is given to the streamer, they receive at best 20% to 30% of the money, and in the worst case, it will be a fixed salary. It's hard to know.</p>
                
                <p>While listening to Kirin-chan's stream in the background, I'm completing many useless tasks. It is specially charming to focus too much on the voice from the earphone and stop moving my hands.</p>
                
                <p>Even so, to think that our school didn't change classes.</p>
                
                <p>It's true that there was no paper posted with names written on it, but I was thinking that they would gather the old class and make the announcement there.</p>
                
                <p>I didn't expect that the classes wouldn't change.</p>
                
                <p>The people in my class were happy that they wouldn't be separated from their friends because there was no class change, but if you're a loner like me, I more like "It'd be better if you go away and reset your friendship! And then get along with me!"</p>
                
                <p>Well, it can't be helped.</p>
                
                <p>The important thing is how to act from here.</p>
                
                <p>As expected of me, I'm starting to think it's time to give up, and live a gray youth life.</p>
                
                <p>In the past, I was still able to have a smooth conversation, but in the past few years I haven't been able to have a good conversation, so when I speak, I am at a loss for words.</p>
                
                <p>At the beginning of a conversation, I would always start with "Ah", "Umm", or "That". To put it simply, my vocal cords had degenerated, and I have turned into a complete komyushou.</p>
                
                <p>This is dangerous.</p>
                
                <p>Far from being in easy mode, this life has become more miserable than my previous life.</p>
                
                <p>When was the last time you looked someone in the eye when you spoke...</p>
                
                <p>For now, let me brush up on my talking skills against Kobayashi-kun.</p>
                
                <p>However, the opponent is a popular person in class who is always surrounded by girls and boys. It might be able to talk with the nerds at the back of the classroom, then to talk to him now and earn a strange grudge from his entourage.</p>
                
                <p>But, I'm still a girl.</p>
                
                <p>I'm bragging right now, but my is of a really beautiful girl.</p>
