# To Do

Make it so the arrows change chapter. [Left Arrow Back, Right Arrow Next]
Is there a need for buttons on top? (Probably not)
I'll have to write something to make the scroling smoother.
It would also be good to add some sort of bookmark feature (Wouldn't I need to make some login system for that though)
Also how should I go about saving the chapters? Saving Both the txt files, and the html would end up taking quite a lot of space for bigger novels. Though the template is only 3KB, and the converted chapter is only 11KB, so I won't have to worry about that for quite a while...

So for now the to-do is:
    Make the keyboard arrows change the chapter. DONE
    Make scrolling trough the page smooth. DONE
    Make it so the font size can be changed on the page, and the preference must be saved. DONE
    Add a chapter selector instead of the current ToC. DONE
    Add a way to bookmark the chapter you're on.
    Add a way to search for novels
    Make it so the nav-bar on mobile has a dropdown menu.

Seems simple enough.
